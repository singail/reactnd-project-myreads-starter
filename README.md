# MyReads Project

This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. For the **MyReads** project, I received a starter code that contained CSS and HTML markup. My goal was to add interactivity to the app using React.js.

## How To Run The Page?

* Clone this git repository by pasting this to the git command line: git clone https://github.com/singail/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

* Start the server with `npm start`. The site will automatically open in `http://localhost:3000`.

## About the App

The app is a library of books displayed in three shelfs ('currently reading', 'want to read', 'read'). The user is able to move books between shelfs as well as navigate to the search page and find more books by typing a query in the serch field.

## Backend Server

The backend server is provided by Udacity.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
